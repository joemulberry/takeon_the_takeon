# My Take-On the Take-On

![The Take On](https://github.com/joemulberry/takeon_the_takeon/blob/main/images/takeon_banner.jpg?raw=true)

### The Introduction  

Some of my favourite moments in football are when a winger receives the ball on the run, goes straight at her defender, with a blur of footwork she leaves the defender for dust. Yet in the data, take-ons are binary boredom - unsuccessful or successful - but we know each take-on is not equal. The public research into take-ons remains embryonic and, largely, unimaginative - which sets the perfect scene for a deeper dive into a action that makes a huge difference in a game.

My research will culminate in a visual dashboard that’s intuitive to consume whilst providing a deeper understanding of a player’s efficiency, objectives and situational tendencies in relation to take-ons. Clubs can be more detailed in their assessment of transfer targets as well as game-preparation to understand the strengths and weaknesses of the opposition’s offensive players.

### The Framework 

The dashboard will be built on top of a new bespoke framework for take-on analysis, whose:

* Close-Quarters Defensive Situational Categorisation 

   Statsbomb 360 data provides us with a freeze-frame of all player positions at the moment of each event. With the take-on location as (0,0), defender locations will be mapped in a 10m diameter around the using KDE and then clustered. The clusterings will be lablled with relevant football language such as 'isolated 1v1' or 'staggered cover' etc. Elements to confirm: 
   * Clustering method? 
   * Orientation, as is? Player -> Centre of Goal?
   * Sidelines and goalines?

* Pre-Action Dynamics

* Phase of Play 

   Using event data and 360 freeze frame information to assertain the 'phase of play' at the time of a take-on. 
   
   


* Value Gained / Lost 

   Using a 'value' system will be used assign +/- value for each take-on.
