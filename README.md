Some of my favourite moments in football are when a winger receives the ball on the run, goes straight at her defender, with a blur of footwork she leaves the defender for dust. Yet in the data, take-ons are binary boredom - unsuccessful or successful - but we know each take-on is not equal. The public research into take-ons remains embryonic and, largely, unimaginative - which sets the perfect scene for a deeper dive into a action that make a huge difference in a game.

My research will culminate in a visual dashboard that’s intuitive to consume whilst providing a deeper understanding of a player’s efficiency, objectives and situational tendencies in relation to take-ons. Clubs can be more detailed in their assessment of transfer targets as well as game-preparation to understand the strengths and weaknesses of the opposition’s offensive players.

The dashboard will be built on top of a new bespoke framework for take-on analysis, whose:

- Defensive Situational Categorisation 

   Statsbomb 360 data provides us with a freeze-frame of all player positions at the moment of each event. With the take-on location as 0,0 defender locations will be mapped in a 10m diameter around the using KDE and then clustered (using ? method). The clusterings will lablled with relevant football language.
